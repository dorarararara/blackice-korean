amph_american_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "With the first experiences with amphibious operations in the Pacific, it quite quickly became apparent that the LVT’s standard firepower was not enough to deal with the bunkers, pillboxes and solidly entrenched positions of the Japanese. Heavier firepower than the usual .5o cal (12.7 mm) was needed. So the idea came to convert some production LVT-2 Water Buffalo as fire support ships with M3 Stuart-like light tank turrets. The “A” stands for armored. 510 units were produced by the Food Machinery Corp. until replacement in 1944 by the better-armed LVT(A)-4s."

amph_american_lv_equipment_1_desc:0 "The LVT of World War 2 fame had its origin in a tracked civilian design, known as the “Alligator”, devised by American engineer Donald Roebling. He specifically designed it as a rescue vehicle, to be utilized in the vast Florida swampy areas (like the Everglades). Its robust tracked nature and boat-like qualities made it ideal for this purpose. The concept dated back as far as 1933. Seeing the value of such a machine, the United States Marine Corps talked to Roebling about modifying his design for military use in 1940."

Indeed, sea water corrosion and the crossing of edgy reefs quickly worn out the previous type of grousers.

The class was laid down in 1936-1937 and all were commissioned in 1939. Much of their design was based on the immediately preceding Gridley and Bagley-class destroyers.

The remaining 24 “repeat Bensons” were authorized in 1940–42 and built at four Bethlehem Steel yards. They were laid down after the first group was commissioned. These plus the “repeat Livermores” (also known as \"repeat Gleaveses\") were also known at the time as the Bristol class.

Fifty were laid down, launched and commissioned within the space of less than two years – 3 November 1942 through to 8 July 1944. These were nearly one third of the 151 carriers built in the United States during the war. It had a larger and more useful hangar deck than previous conversions. It also had a larger flight deck than the Bogue class. Unlike larger carriers which had extensive armor, protection was limited to splinter plating and therefore the carrier design was very vulnerable."
 USA_ecarrier_5:0 "Commencement Bay Class CVE"

Significantly, V-1, V-2, and V-3 were the only members of the class designed to satisfy the Navy's original \"fleet boat\" requirement for high surface speed. These were large and powerfully engined submarines, displacing 2,119 long tons (2,153 t) surfaced and 2,506 long tons (2,546 t) submerged on a length of 342 ft (104 m).

Displacing 4,164 long tons (4,231 t) submerged, V-4—later USS Argonaut (SM-1)—was both the largest submarine the Navy ever built before the advent of nuclear power and the only U.S. submarine specifically designed as a minelayer. Her configuration, and that of the following V-5 and V-6, resulted from an evolving strategic concept that increasingly emphasized the possibility of a naval war with Japan in the far western Pacific. This factor, and the implications of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, suggested the need for long-range submarine \"cruisers\", or \"strategic scouts\", as well as long-range minelayers, for which long endurance, not high speed, was most important."

In their overall appearance and dimensions, V-5, later Narwhal and V-6, later Nautilus were similar to Argonaut and constituted \"submarine cruiser\" counterparts at least partially inspired by German success with long-range submarine commerce raiders of the Type U-139 and Type U-151 U-boat classes in World War I. Endurance, sea-keeping, increased torpedo capacity, and large deck guns were emphasized at the cost of high speed. In addition to the customary torpedo tubes—four forward and two aft with 24 torpedoes (eight external) —they (and Argonaut) carried two 6 inch (152 mm)/53 caliber deck guns, the largest ever mounted on U.S. submarines."

The armament was similar to Dolphin: six 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes (4 bow, 2 stern), with 16 torpedoes. A 3 inch (76 mm)/50 caliber deck gun was equipped, a decrease in gun caliber that would persist through early World War II. In the 1930s it was felt that a larger gun would encourage submarine captains to fight on the surface against superior anti-submarine ships, but eventually war experience showed that a larger gun was needed."
