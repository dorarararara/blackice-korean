It was intended to take on the roles of army-level reconnaissance and security that had traditionally been the responsibility of cavalry. It included mechanized recon units, motorized infantry, and a battalion of tanks. The concept of the Leichte Brigade, of which three were planned by the Wehrmacht, quickly showed its flawed nature and was abandoned.\nIn November 1938 the brigade was enlarged to become the §Y1.

Following the latter the division received 130 Czech-built tanks which were superior to the Panzer I and Panzer II the division had been equipped with.

It was created to consolidate the many small prisons that had been set up by various police agencies and the NSDAP to house political prisoners. The organizational structure Eicke instituted at Dachau stood as the model for all later prisons. After 1934, Eicke was named commander of the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV), the SS formation responsible for running the prisons under the authority of the SS and Himmler. Known as the \"Death's Head Units\", the SS-TV was first organized as several battalions, each based at one of Germany's major prison. Leadership at the prisons was divided into five departments: commander and adjutant, political affairs division, protective custody, administration, and medical personnel. By 1935, Himmler secured Hitler's approval and the finances necessary to establish and operate additional prisons. Six prisons housing 21,400 inmates (mostly political prisoners) existed at the start of the war in September 1939. By the end of the war, hundreds of prisons of varying size and function had been created, holding nearly 715,000 people."
