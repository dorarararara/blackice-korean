 GER_motorized_AC_equipment_08_desc:0 "The poor performances of the first, “6-rad” (six wheeled) model led to a complete redesign by Bussing-NAG, with a eight-wheeled vehicle with fully independent steering wheels and a much more powerful engine. The Büssing-NAG 8×8 truck chassis was relatively complex and costly to build, each independent wheel being independently steered and suspended. In fact, when it was first produced in 1937, this was the most advanced armored car in the world. Although some features of the former chassis and sloped bodywork were loosely kept, the biggest change was swapping the positions of the driver and engine. This allowed better visibility and control for the driver, better protection for the engine in a roomier, fully separate compartment, and more fuel was carried. The seats for the commander and gunner were attached to the hand traversed turret, which was of hexagonal shape for added internal space, but the armament was identical. There was still a reverse driver/radio operator, but the extra pair of wheels made for a far better grip and the all-independent steering wheels gave an unprecedented level of maneuverability on all kinds of terrains. In all, the 8 rad was well received by the army reconnaissance units and began to replace its predecessor in some units."

During the invasion of the Soviet Union, increasing numbers of semi-automatic Tokarev SVT-38 and SVT-40s were used by the Red Army - mostly elite units and non-commissioned officers - while some Soviet rifle companies were completely equipped with PPSh-41 submachine guns. /nAfter experiencing high volumes of automatic fire from these weapons, German commanders re-thought their small arms requirements. The German army had been attempting to introduce semi-automatic weapons such as the Gewehr 41, but these proved troublesome in service, and production was insufficient to meet requirements. /nSeveral attempts had been made to introduce lightweight machine guns or automatic rifles, but recoil from the powerful 7.92×57mm Mauser round was too difficult to control in automatic fire. /n By 1941, it was becoming clear that action needed to be taken. Although various experimental rounds had been developed to one degree or another by this point, the Army instead decided to select yet a new design, the Polte 8×33mm Kurzpatrone (\"short cartridge\"). This used a spitzer bullet and basic cartridge design of the standard 7.92×57mm Mauser rifle cartridge, cutting down the cartridge from the original 7.92×57mm Mauser to 7.92×33mm Kurz. It was understood that this was not ideal, but it would minimize logistical problems."

Surface speed would have increased by 1.6 knots to 18.6kt.\nThe pressure hull was both lengthened and increased in diameter to house additional equipment.\nHowever the most significant improvement of this design was for the material of the hull to be fabricated by armored quality steel. With the planned increase in thickness to 1.1in (28mm), the crush depth of this boat would have been an astonishing 1,640ft (500m)."

 GER_lr_patrol_submarine_1:0 "Type IXB SS LR"
 GER_lr_patrol_submarine_1_desc:0 "Fourteen Type IXBs were built. The fuel capacity was increased from 154 tons to 165 tons, giving a slightly extended range from 8,100nm to 8,700nm."
 GER_lr_patrol_submarine_2:0 "Type IXC SS LR"
 GER_lr_patrol_submarine_2_desc:0 "Fifty four Type IXCs were built. The main difference was an increased fuel capacity to 208 tons, resulting in an extended range from 8,700nm to 11,000nm. This subclass onward had two periscopes, both housed within the conning tower."
 GER_lr_patrol_submarine_3:0 "Type IXC/41 SS LR"

 GER_lr_patrol_submarine_4_desc:0 "Only two Type IXD1s were built, U-180 and U-195. Their standard diesel engines were substituted with six Daimler Benz MB501 diesels, producing an output of 1,500hp each. Though the maximum range was somewhat reduced, this design could achieve a respectable top speed in excess of 20 knots. Considerable technical problems were encountered, including overheating and the emission of white exhaust smoke which was visible for miles. The unsatisfactory engines were removed and the original MAN engines were reinstalled. They were later converted to transport U-boats and could to carry up to 252 tons of cargo. In this configuration, the torpedo tubes were removed to provide additional cargo room. Both variants of the Type IXD1s were equipped with a Focke Achgelis, a rotary winged kite for making distant observations."
 GER_lr_patrol_submarine_5:0 "Type IXD2 SS LR"
 GER_lr_patrol_submarine_5_desc:0 "Twenty eight Type IXD2s were built. In addition to their standard MAN diesel engines, this variant had two additional six cylinder diesels which could be used for cruising on the surface. They had additional fuel bunkers, giving them the exceptional range of 23,700nm – the longest range of any German attack U-boat. Like the IXD1, it was equipped with a Focke Achgelis kite."

 GER_lr_patrol_submarine_6_desc:0 "Type XXI submarines, also known as 'Elektroboote', were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as surface ships that could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack. Its key features were its streamlined hull and conning tower and its large number of battery cells. It was among the largest of the German submarine classes, displacing over 1,620 tons. There were 118 ships commissioned between 1943 and 1945."

The 150 mm twin turrets had been manufactured for planned, but never built, \"O\" class battlecruisers.

Based on traditional destroyer design, several project studies started in 1938 to develop a large destroyer of the size of a CL. Like most German CLs, those ships were planed to get a mixed propulsion system, geared turbines for high speed and diesel engines for long cruises. The first three ships (SP1, SP2, and SP3, formerly named Z40, Z41, Z42) were ordered in February 1941 at the Germania Shipyard in Kiel. In December of 1941, the engines for the next three ships (SP4, SP5, SP6) were  ordered too, but not the ships themselves."

The ships of the class, Deutschland, Admiral Scheer and Admiral Graf Spee, were all stated to displace 10,000 long tons (10,000 t) in accordance with the Treaty, though they actually displaced 10,600 to 12,340 long tons (10,770 to 12,540 t) at standard displacement. Despite violating the weight limitation, the design for the ships incorporated several radical innovations to save weight. They were the first major warships to use welding and all-diesel propulsion. Due to their heavy armament of six 28 cm (11 in) guns, the British began referring to the vessels as pocket battleships. The Deutschland-class ships were initially classified as Panzerschiffe or armored ships, but the Kriegsmarine reclassified them as heavy cruisers in February 1940."

The class comprised Deutschland, Hannover, Pommern, Schlesien, and Schleswig-Holstein and were built between 1903 and 1908. The Treaty of Versailles permitted Germany to retain several old battleships for coastal defense, including the four Deutschland-class ships. However, instead of being used as a coastal defense ship, Deutschland was broken up in 1920–1922. Hannover was to be converted into a target vessel, although this was never done. She was eventually broken up in 1944–1946. Schlesien and Schleswig-Holstein were the only two vessels of the class to see continued front-line service in the Reichsmarine and later the Kriegsmarine. Both ships saw limited duty during World War II, which was inaugurated by the firing of Schleswig-Holstein's main guns at the Polish fortress at Westerplatte. Near the end of the war the two ships were both sunk."

After the outbreak of war, the ships were requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine as transports, and in May 1942, plans were drawn up to convert them into aircraft carriers. The ships were not identical, but were similar enough in size to allow identical outfitting. Gneisenau and Potsdam were to be renamed Jade and Elbe, respectively.
