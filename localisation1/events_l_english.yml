 spain.55.d:0 "After the disastrous War of the Rif of 1921, the popularity of king Alfonso XII was very low. It further dropped when the king authorized the formation of a military dictatorship under general Miguel Primo de Rivera, ignoring his own Constitution. This led to a hatred of the king among the majority of Spanish society. As a result, in 1931, two years after the end of the dictatorship, the Second Republic was proclaimed and king Alfonso XII fled the country. \n\nThe first republican government was led by Manuel Azaña and it was a coalition between republicans, liberals and socialists. It passed important reforms ( Agrarian, Military and Education ) which angered the right and, due to their slow application, the left. Disputes between socialists and republicans led to the breakup of the government and the right-wing CEDA victory in the 1933 election. \n\nPresident Alcalá-Zamora, afraid of the CEDA, appointed the liberal Alejandro Lerroux as head of government, although he had to appoint some CEDA ministers as well. This provoked a socialist revolution in 1934 that was put down by the army. After one year of relative stability, Lerroux resigned due to a corruption scandal. Alcalá-Zamora refused to allow a CEDA government and disbanded the parliament, calling for new elections in February 1936. In the meantime, a provisional government run by the liberal veteran Manuel Portela, friend of Zamora, was in charge of the country."

He immediately began tapping out the pre-arranged code signal: 'TO, TO, TO...'\nLeading the whole group, Lieutenant Commander Murata's torpedo bombers headed downward to launch their torpedoes, while Lieutenant Commander Itayay's fighters raced forward to sweep enemy fighters from the air. Takahashi's dive-bomber group had climbed for altitude and was out of sight. My bombers, meanwhile, made a circuit toward Barbers Point to keep pace with the attack schedule. No enemy fighters were in the air, nor were there any gun flashes from the ground.\nAs the bombers completed their runs they headed north to return to the carriers.

As the capital of British India, this city is of immense strategic importance and its loss may prove to be a decisive factor in the ongoing Indian campaign.\n\nThe Viceroy himself was reportedly captured by Japanese forward units while he was supervising the transfer of his belongings from the Viceroy's House to a truck caravan, but this has not yet been confirmed."
 news.127.t:0 "The Fall of the Panama Canal"
 news.127.d:0 "In what must be considered a monumental blow to the American war effort, Japanese forces have landed in Panama and taken control of the canal after forcing the surrender of its garrison. Several parties of American and Panamanian soldiers reportedly escaped into the nearby jungle to wage guerrilla warfare, but it is not believed that they can significantly threaten the Japanese presence.\n\nWith the fall of the canal, American naval forces now have to round South America to reach the US West Coast, giving the Imperial Japanese Navy a significant strategic advantage."
 news.128.t:0 "The Fall of Berlin"
 news.128.d:0 "The capture of the German capital has been confirmed by officials in Washington, after US forces fought their way into Berlin from several directions. Fighting in the city was described as intense, with the Moltke Bridge being demolished by desperate German pioneers to halt the American advance.\n\nOther bridges over the Spree were eventually secured, and GIs successfully stormed the Kroll Opera House and the Reichstag despite fierce German resistance. The Stars and Stripes now flutters in the wind above the Reichstag, and fighting in the city has ceased. The Battle of Berlin is over."

 news.129.d:0 "British forces have advanced into Berlin, and the War Cabinet has announced the successful capture of the German capital after a pitched battle. Striking at dawn, British commandos seized the Tempelhof Airport while armored columns advanced along the Frankfurter Allee.\n\nWith the Reich Chancellery under British control, fighting in the city has largely ended. The current status of the German government remains unclear, but it is believed that at least some elements of it escaped the city before its fall."
 news.129.b:0 "Smashing good job, lads!"
 news.130.d:0 "French forces have successfully stormed the German capital, which fell after a series of pitched battles within the city limits. A large group of Waffen-SS soldiers barricaded themselves in the Olympiastadion, which eventually fell after a determined attack by Foreign Legionnaires supported by artillery.\n\nThe French tricolor can now be seen flying over the Reich Chancellery, and although sporadic fighting is still being reported from some suburbs, most of Berlin is believed to have been cleared of organized resistance."
 news.130.b:0 "Vive la France!"
 news.131.d:0 "Desperate fighting has been reported from Berlin, the capital of Germany, but it is now believed that the city is completely in Polish hands. After advancing along the Frankfurter Allee, the Poles reached the Alexanderplatz which was the scene of a pitched battle.\n\nElsewhere in the city, the Brandenburg Gate collapsed, supposedly after being rammed by a Polish tank, and the Kroll Opera House was leveled by an artillery barrage after its stubborn SS defenders refused to surrender. The red and white of the Polish flag now flies above the Reichstag, and the last pockets of resistance have been dealt with."

 news.132.d:0 "Allied forces recently entered Rome after the surrender of its garrison, and the city is now under military occupation. Most historical landmarks remain intact, having weathered yet another battle for control over the city. For now at least, Allied troops have stayed outside Vatican City at the request of the Holy See.\n\nThe fall of Rome is an important milestone in the Italian campaign, and some are wondering if this means an end of the organized resistance to the advancing Allied armies on the peninsula."
 news.132.b:0 "A great victory!"
 news.133.d:0 "Forces from France recently entered Rome after the city's remaining Italian garrison melted away into the surrounding countryside. The French troops moved quickly to occupy all significant government buildings, and a 'triumph' was held along the Via del Corso by a long procession of marching soldiers and armored vehicles.\n\nWith the fall of Rome, the ability of Italy to continue the war is put into question. Outside observers expect that the Italian government, who fled the city just before its fall, will soon begin surrender negotiations."
 news.134.t:0 "The Liberation of Paris"
 news.134.d:0 "It has now been confirmed that Paris, the capital of France, has been liberated from German occupation. Allied forces have entered the city, and the remaining German garrison has surrendered. Parisians could be seen cheering their liberators as they marched down the Champs Élysées, even while there were rumors of German sniper fire in some parts of the city.\n\nIt was feared that the Germans would employ a strategy of scorched earth and leave Paris a burning ruin, but the city's landmarks appear to have been spared. Indeed, the French tricolor can even now be seen flying from the Eiffel Tower."

 news.135.d:0 "American forces have entered Tokyo, and the US War Department recently announced an end to major combat operations in the city. Fighting was reported as heavy, particularly in the vicinity of the Imperial Palace which was defended by fanatical members of the Imperial Guard, even though the Emperor is believed to have left the city before the American assault began.\n\nWith the fall of Tokyo, experts predict that organized resistance on the rest of the Japanese Home Islands will soon crumble. Peace negotiations are expected to begin shortly, unless Japanese hardliners convince the Emperor to continue the fight to the death."
 news.136.d:0 "After a series of pitched battles, Allied forces have occupied Moscow, capital of the Soviet Union. The city has suffered extensive damage, and fires are still raging on both sides of the Moskva river. Despite heavy bombing the Kremlin is reasonably intact, and it has been chosen as the location for the headquarters of the Allied Occupation Administration.\n\nWith the loss of Moscow, the Soviet war effort has suffered an enormous blow. Although most of the government is believed to have evacuated the city well in advance of its fall, military experts claim that a complete Soviet collapse may not be far away."
 news.137.t:0 "The Liberation of London"
 news.137.d:0 "Fighting has ended in London, with the last pockets of German resistance having been dealt with. As soon as the all-clear was given, jubilant crowds rushed onto the streets to celebrate their American liberators, while church bells could be heard ringing throughout the city.\n\nLiberation fever seems to be embracing Britain, as it now finally appears likely that the German occupation is coming to an end. Spontaneous uprisings have been reported in areas still under German control, though these incidents have been dealt with harshly. Has freedom at last returned to the United Kingdom?"
 news.138.d:0 "Unlike 1920, there was no 'Miracle at the Vistula' when Soviet armies recently approached Warsaw. Polish resistance in the city has largely collapsed, and the Soviet flag can be seen raised over most government buildings.\n\nAre we witnessing the end of the Polish nation, or will their forces somehow manage to rebound and retake their capital? Most experts consider this scenario unlikely."
 news.138.b:0 "Onwards, comrades!"

 news.139.d:0 "The devastated city of Warsaw has fallen to advancing Soviet armies, after the last German defenders retreated from its burning suburbs. Much of the city lies in ruins after previous battles, and local resistance members hurriedly emerged from the rubble to greet their liberators.\n\nWith Warsaw under Soviet control, the strategic situation for Germany in Eastern Europe may soon deteriorate further. Experts are doubtful that they will be able to mount a counterattack to retake the city, but the harried local population does not seem quite as convinced."

 news.140.d:0 "A Soviet communique has announced the capitulation of all German forces in Berlin. After encircling the city, the Russians stormed it from several different directions, with the German defenders resisting furiously every step of the way.\n\nSoviet troops finally fought their way across the Moltke Bridge and into the Reichstag building, fighting room by room until they reached the roof where the Soviet flag was raised over the city. The Battle of Berlin is over."

 news.141.d:0 "Rome, the 'Eternal City,' has fallen to the advancing Soviet spearheads. As Italian forces fell back, Russian troops fanned out into the city and dealt with the few remaining pockets of resistance. Most historical landmarks appear to have suffered little damage, although there are conflicting reports that the Pantheon was raked by machine gun fire.\n\nSo far the Soviets appear to be respecting the neutrality of the Holy See, but their forces have positioned themselves in a ring around Vatican City - a gesture that must surely make His Holiness nervous."
 news.142.d:0 "The inexorable advance of the Red Army continues, and reports are now coming in that the French capital has fallen. French Communists supposedly aided the Soviets when they entered the city, taking part in attacks against retreating elements of the armée de terre.\n\nLeaflets have been distributed throughout the city, informing Parisians that they have been 'liberated from the Bourgeoisie oppression' and that the Paris Commune has finally been resurrected."
 news.143.d:0 "In the latest Order of the Day broadcast from Moscow, the capture of Paris from German forces was announced. Many of the city's defenders reportedly drowned in the Seine after a heavy Soviet artillery barrage demolished several of the bridges crossing the river.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower was toppled after a massive explosion at its base, although it remains unclear which side was responsible. Soviet forces are now holding a victory parade on the Champs-Élysées while weary Parisians look on, wondering if they have only traded one occupier for another."

A parade was quickly organized by the Red Army, even before the last pockets of resistance in the city had been fully dealt with.\n\nCommunist sympathizers have been quick to turn in the names of known anti-communists to the Soviet military authorities, and a People's Court has convened at Trafalgar Square to punish the worst offenders."
 news.145.d:0 "Fires continue to rage in central London, but it is believed that most of the city's German occupiers have either fallen in battle or been captured by the advancing Soviet forces. Crowds have emerged on the streets to cheer the Russians on as they move to deal with the last stubborn holdouts.\n\nCollaborators have been dealt with harshly, and the Soviets have organized an interim council to administrate the liberated city until further notice. Critics have observed that the members of this council all appear to have been drawn from the Communist Party of Great Britain."

 news.146.d:0 "Soviet forces have converged on Tokyo, and heavy fighting has been reported throughout the city. Most of the city is under Soviet control now, with the exception of the eastern suburbs where massive fires are still raging.\n\nWhen the fighting shifted towards the Imperial Palace, members of the Imperial Guard reportedly launched bayonet charges against the approaching Soviet troops. The palace was eventually stormed by a detachment of VDV paratroopers, who had to fight their way through the compound room by room. No prisoners were taken, but it is believed that the Emperor was safely evacuated before the city fell."
 news.147.d:0 "Leningrad, the former capital of the Russian Empire, has been occupied by Finnish forces. With a population of over three million, the city has nearly as many inhabitants as all of Finland, but this fact has evidently not deterred the Finnish attackers.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether the city should be integrated into Greater Finland, since Ingrian Finns make up a considerable minority in the regions outside the city. This, of course, assumes that the Red Army is unable to retake the city in a counteroffensive."
 news.148.d:0 "News coming in from Tokyo recently confirmed that the city has fallen to Chinese forces. Much of it lies in ruins, including the Imperial Palace which now serves as the headquarters of the Chinese military administration.\n\nForeign reporters witnessed a massive victory parade that featured a seemingly endless procession of Chinese soldiers marching through the city. Japanese citizens lining the streets watched the parading troops in silence."

News coming in from the territory report that most of the garrison has surrendered, although a few stubborn holdouts have retreated to tunnels running under the Rock.\n\nAt a press conference in Madrid, representatives of the government stated that Gibraltar is henceforth to be considered Spanish territory 'in perpetuity.' British diplomats have unsurprisingly debunked the statement, dismissing it as 'utter nonsense.'"

Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."

Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid.

Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."

Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state.

The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed.

In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent.

The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."

Tearing down the cult of personality he built up will take time, but the people know now at least that he was not immortal.\n\n One of the few survivors who managed to escape was Ivan Konev.

 stability.21.desc.a:0 "A new report by the War Office shows a marked reduction in available manpower. It appears that the latest batch of recruits is much smaller than initially expected. The discrepacy is currently under investigation, but first leads point towards a large number of people who are technically fit for service managing to avoid the draft through various means. 18 year old students are suddenly skilled workers employed in critical war industry, former athletes fail their fitness tests and in some cases, recruits have simply vanished without a trace.\n\nWhen people are caught and interrogated, they point towards the poor conditions in the army, the indifferent officers and not wanting to die for a lost cause. Military leaders demand a harsh crackdown on people avoiding the draft, but many in the government believe that improving the living conditions of enlisted soldiers might be the better approach."
 stability.21.desc.b:0 "The ineffective official response to the widespread avoidance of the draft has only made the problem worse. More and more recruits never show up after receiving their drafting letter. Counter-Intelligence has intercepted a professionally made pamphlet advising people on how to avoid the draft, suggesting things like bribing doctors to certify the recruit to be medically unfit. Exceptions for family fathers have led to war widows with children finding themselves mobbed with marriage proposals while the number of people applying for exceptions for ethical reasons have hit record numbers.\n\nMilitary leaders have suggested eliminating the last few exceptions and make examples out of a few shirkers that have been caught. Others in the government have suggested that we should appeal to the sense of civic duty in our citizens and point out the consequences of a defeat in this war."
 stability.21.desc.c:0 "With government responses to draft dodging having no positive effects whatsoever, more and more people have started to wonder why they should put themselves at risk while others stay in safety. Recruits that do turn up often report being harrassed or ridiculed in the streets as fools fighting for a doomed cause.

Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military and escorted to the barracks under armed guard, where they will be formed up into a separate unit, to avoid their subversive influence from spreading to other units. \n\nThe news of this has spread quickly, and it appears that most people who until now believed that they could get away with ignoring their draft notice have changed their mind.

Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military. Their families have mobilized their extensive support networks to protest this descision. The War Office has been flooded with calls and letters from simple workers who want their factory manager back to undersecretaries in various other ministeries, demanding to know why people working in fields critical to the war effort have been removed from their work.

Claiming to be from a soldier who at first tried to avoid the draft, but then realized that he must fight to save his country, it has apparently struck a nerve with many others who felt similarly.

Mass peace demonstrations have started in several major cities, demanding an end to the war.
