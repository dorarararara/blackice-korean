 NEW_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 NEW_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 NEW_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 NEW_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 NEW_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 NEW_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 NEW_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 NEW_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 NEW_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 NEW_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 NEW_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 NEW_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 NEW_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 NEW_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 NEW_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 NEW_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 NEW_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 NEW_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 NEW_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 NEW_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 NEW_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 NEW_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 NEW_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 NEW_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 NEW_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 NEW_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 NEW_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 NEW_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 NEW_battleship_1:0 "Queen Elizabeth Class"
 NEW_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Queen Elizabeth-class battleships were ordered under the 1912 Naval Program. These ships were the first to be equipped with 15 in. guns, and were considered the first fast battleships. They carried heavy armament for both primary and secondary roles and their thick armor made these vessels excellent warships, ideal for protecting the vast British Empire. Six ships were ordered but only five were commissioned and later modernized prior to WWII."
 NEW_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 NEW_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 NEW_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 NEW_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 NEW_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 NEW_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 NEW_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 NEW_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 NEW_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 NEW_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 NEW_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 NEW_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 NEW_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 NEW_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 NEW_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 NEW_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 NEW_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 NEW_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."

 tech_britishnaval_sub_desc:0 "The Royal Navy Submarine Service is the submarine element of the Royal Navy. It is sometimes known as the Silent Service, as the submarines are generally required to operate undetected. At the beginning of the 20th century, the idea of submarine warfare was considered by senior personnel in the Admiralty to be \"Underhand, unfair and damned un-English\". But since other navies were developing submarines, the Royal Navy had no choice but to do the same."

The idea of a submarine cruiser had been proposed as early as 1915, but was not put into practice until 1921. X1 carried four QF 5.2 inch Mk I guns in twin unarmoured turrets, one forward and one aft of the conning tower. Her six torpedo tubes came from a cancelled L-class submarine and she was provided with one reload for each tube."

As part of the major naval construction for the Royal Navy during the Second World War, the S class became the largest single group of submarines ever built for the Royal Navy.

Fifty-three members of the class were built just before and during the Second World War, where they played a major role in the Royal Navy's submarine operations. Four boats in service with the Royal Netherlands Navy were known as the Zwaardvisch class. The ten-torpedo salvo was the largest ever fitted to an operational submarine in the Royal Navy. Fifty-three T-class submarines were built before and during the war in three distinct groups, although there were minor differences between boats within the same group."

The external bow torpedo tubes were moved seven feet aft to help with sea keeping. The two external forward-angled tubes just forward of conning tower were repositioned aft of it and angled backwards to fire astern, and a stern external torpedo tube was also fitted. This gave a total of eight forward-facing tubes and three rear-facing ones. All Group Two boats were sent to the Mediterranean, only Thrasher and Trusty returned."

The V-class submarines were very similar to the preceding U-class (short-hull) boats, of which they constituted a linear development, but had 3/4-inch pressure hull plating instead of 1/2-inch for deeper diving, also a lengthened stern and fining at the bows to reduce noise and improve underwater handling."
 rn_patrol_submarine_16:0 "S-Class SS (3rd Group)"
 rn_patrol_submarine_16_desc:0 "Last and most sophisticated version of the S-class. The third and by far the most numerous group of S-class submarines consisted of 50 boats.

 rn_patrol_submarine_17:0 "A-Class SS"
 rn_patrol_submarine_17_desc:0 "The Amphion class (also known as the \"A\" class and Acheron class) of British diesel-electric submarines were designed for use in the Pacific War. Only two were completed before the end of hostilities, but following modernisation in the 1950s, they continued to serve in the Royal Navy into the 1970s. They were considered the most sophisticated submarines of the Royal Navy by the end of the war. Wartime experience had shown that submarines had to operate further from the United Kingdom and with larger patrol areas than had been foreseen—in the Far East and Mediterranean for example—so the faster and slightly larger A class was designed to have a longer range than the T class, with accommodation suitable for longer missions."

The V-class submarines were very similar to the preceding U-class (short-hull) boats, of which they constituted a linear development, but had 3/4-inch pressure hull plating instead of 1/2-inch for deeper diving, also a lengthened stern and fining at the bows to reduce noise and improve underwater handling."

Only two were completed before the end of hostilities, but following modernisation in the 1950s, they continued to serve in the Royal Navy into the 1970s. They were considered the most sophisticated submarines of the Royal Navy by the end of the war. Wartime experience had shown that submarines had to operate further from the United Kingdom and with larger patrol areas than had been foreseen—in the Far East and Mediterranean for example—so the faster and slightly larger A class was designed to have a longer range than the T class, with accommodation suitable for longer missions."

 ENG_carrier_2b_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was a four ship class (Illustrious, Formidable, Victorious and Indomitable) of aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy. They were laid down in the late 1930s as part of the rearmament of British forces in response to the emerging threats of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan. The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. It was one of the first carrier designs featuring a armored flight deck for better protection against dive bombers."
 ENG_carrier_2c:0 "Indomitable Class CV IIc"
 ENG_carrier_2c_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was a four ship class (Illustrious, Formidable, Victorious and Indomitable) of aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy. The Indomitable had a smaller air wing to be carried due to its smaller parking deck and increased armor protection."
 ENG_carrier_3:0 "Implacable class CV III"
 ENG_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Programme and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 ENG_carrier_3b:0 "Audacious class CV IIIb"
 ENG_carrier_3b_desc:0 "The Audacious-class aircraft carriers were a class of two 36.800 ton aircraft carriers built for the Royal Navy. The Audacious class was originally designed as an expansion of the Implacable class with double storied hangars. However, it was realised that the hangar height would not be sufficient for the new aircraft that were expected to enter service, so the design was considerably enlarged. Instead, the Audacious-class had almost doubleed operational range."
 ENG_scarrier_1:0 "Malta Class SCV I"
 ENG_scarrier_1_desc:0 "The Malta class aircraft carrier was a design based on American experiences in the Pacific. Four were ordered in 1943 but repeated design changes caused delays and when the War ended they were cancelled before building had begun."

 ENG_lcarrier_1_desc:0 "Projected as aircraft maintenance ship, the Unicorn became the Royal Navys first light carrier desgin carrying 35 aircraft with a reasonable top speed of 24 knots and strong anti aircraft armament and operational range. The Unicorn-class was cheap and fast to built and functioned as a support carrier for the bigger fleet carriers of the Illustrious-class."
 ENG_lcarrier_2:0 "Colossus Class CVL II"
 ENG_lcarrier_2_desc:0 "The 1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier, commonly referred to as the British Light Fleet Carrier, was a light aircraft carrier design created by the Royal Navy during World War II. In summary fifteen carries have been produced and the design proofed to be successful as the superior operational range made the class much more useful for e.g. convoy protection."
 ENG_lcarrier_3:0 "Centaur Class CVL III"
 ENG_lcarrier_3_desc:0 "The Centaur class of aircraft carriers of the Royal Navy was the last of the light fleet carrier designs of which four 26.000 tons units have been built during the war. It had a higher speed more suitable to operate together with the main carrier fleet of the Royal Navy and carried a larger air group of 42 aircraft. These improvements came with a higher production cost."
 ENG_ecarrier_1:0 "Audacity Class CVE I"
 ENG_ecarrier_1_desc:0 "The HMS Audacity was a British escort carrier of the Second World War and the first of her kind. She was originally the German merchant ship Hannover, which the Royal Navy captured in the West Indies. Due to being a merchant vessel before, its design and captabilities were very weak but cost efficient to produce in high numbers. The escort carrier only embarked 8 aircraft vessels."
 ENG_ecarrier_2:0 "Avenger Class CVE II"
 ENG_ecarrier_2_desc:0 "The Avenger-class escort carrier was a class of 8.200 tons escort carriers comprising four ships in service with the Royal Navy. The Avenger design was an improvement compared to the previous Audacity-class and carried a larger air wing and better anti aircraft protection. The ships had a complement of 555 men and an overall length of 492.25 feet (150.04 m), a beam of 66.25 feet (20.19 m) and a height of 23.25 ft (7.09 m)."
 ENG_ecarrier_3:0 "Attacker Class CVE III"
 ENG_ecarrier_3_desc:0 "Attacker-class escort carriers were a type of aircraft carrier in service with the British Royal Navy during the Second World War. There were eight ships in the class, all constructed in the United States and supplied under the terms of Lend-Lease to the Royal Navy. The Attacker-class featured a larger air wing, double anti aircraft protection and some structural hull improvements making it more reliable during combat missions."
 ENG_ecarrier_4:0 "Ruler Class CVE IV"
 ENG_ecarrier_4_desc:0 "The Ruler class of escort aircraft carriers served with the Royal Navy during the Second World War. All twenty-five ships were built by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation in the United States as Bogue-class escort carriers, supplied under Lend-Lease to the United Kingdom. They were the most numerous single class of aircraft carriers in service with the Royal Navy. The Ruler-class was based on the Attacker-class but with a very strong anti aircraft armament making it a floating threat to aircrafts during convoy defense missions and naval aviation attacks."
 ENG_ecarrier_5:0 "Activity Class CVE V"
 ENG_ecarrier_5_desc:0 "HMS Activity was built at Caledon shipyards in Dundee. When construction started in 1940 she was intended to become the refrigerated cargo ship. In January 1942, she was requisitioned by the Admiralty for conversion to an escort carrier, now named HMS Activity and carrying pennant number D94. It had a higher speed of 18 knots and good anti aircraft armament and carrying just a small air wing of eleven aircrafts. The reduced operational range limited her usefulness significantly."
 ENG_ecarrier_6:0 "Nairana Class CVe VI"
 ENG_ecarrier_6_desc:0 "The Nairana-class escort carrier was a British-built class of three 14.000 tons escort carriers. They were constructed one each in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland to the same basic design during the Second World War for service with the Royal Navy. Converted from merchant ships, they were only able to accommodate a composite squadron of about 15–20 aircraft. The Nairana-class was mostly used for convoy escort duties with its high operational range and very good anti-aircraft armament."

These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 AST_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 AST_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."

 AST_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 AST_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy with quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 AST_battleship_1:0 "Queen Elizabeth Class"
 AST_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Queen Elizabeth-class battleships were ordered under the 1912 Naval Program. These ships were the first to be equipped with 15 in. guns, and were considered the first fast battleships. They carried heavy armament for both primary and secondary roles and their thick armor made these vessels excellent warships, ideal for protecting the vast British Empire. Six ships were ordered but only five were commissioned and later modernized prior to WWII."
 AST_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 AST_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."

Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 AST_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 AST_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."

Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 RAJ_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 RAJ_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes were the same as in the F class, with both using on the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 RAJ_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 RAJ_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 RAJ_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 RAJ_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war. The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 RAJ_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 RAJ_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "C-class light cruisers were a group of twenty-eight light cruisers of the Royal Navy. They were built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions. Only a limited number of the vessels survived the scrap head to WWI. Only the Caledon, Ceres, and Carlisle subclasses were in service by the mid 1930's."
 RAJ_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 RAJ_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 RAJ_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 RAJ_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 RAJ_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 RAJ_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 RAJ_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 RAJ_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 RAJ_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 RAJ_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 RAJ_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 RAJ_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 RAJ_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 RAJ_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 RAJ_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 RAJ_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 RAJ_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 RAJ_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 RAJ_battleship_1:0 "Queen Elizabeth Class"
 RAJ_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Queen Elizabeth-class battleships were ordered under the 1912 Naval Program. These ships were the first to be equipped with 15 in. guns, and were considered the first fast battleships. They carried heavy armament for both primary and secondary roles and their thick armor made these vessels excellent warships, ideal for protecting the vast British Empire. Six ships were ordered but only five were commissioned and later modernized prior to WWII."
 RAJ_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 RAJ_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 RAJ_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 RAJ_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 RAJ_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 RAJ_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 RAJ_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 RAJ_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 RAJ_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 RAJ_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 RAJ_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 RAJ_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 RAJ_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 RAJ_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 RAJ_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 RAJ_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range. "
 RAJ_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 RAJ_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."

They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 SAF_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 SAF_submarine_2_desc:0 "The T-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 SAF_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 SAF_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 SAF_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
